# Immediate Work
- Add gitignore for .txt files in solutions (and tweak telescope to ignore that)
- Move inputs into solutions
- Use kv .solutions file, rather than individual ones
- Remove problems/
- Promote solutions/<years>/ to <years>/
- Add support for 25+ new languages
- Rename spl -> shakespeare
- Decouple shakespare from pip install
- Purge usage of solutions.yml files
- Audit for unneeded crates

# Languages to add
- Whitespace
- Curry
- Atomy
- Velato
- Piet

# Future Ideas
- Enhance fetch to check problem for previously confirmed solutions
- Detect an empty last line of STDOUT for easy submission/save-skipping
- Add a declutter command that discards saved answers for example inputs
