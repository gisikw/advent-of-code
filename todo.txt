# Immediate Work
- Be explicit about nix flake, to avoid the searching up warning
- Create nix devShells for currently-supported languages
- Add gitignore for .txt files in solutions (and tweak telescope to ignore that)
- Move inputs into solutions
- Use kv .solutions file, rather than individual ones
- Remove problems/
- Promote solutions/<years>/ to <years>/
- Purge docker logic
- Add support for 25+ new languages
- Keep using docker for the languages that need x86 linux

# Future Ideas
- Enhance fetch to check problem for previously confirmed solutions
- Detect an empty last line of STDOUT for easy submission/save-skipping
